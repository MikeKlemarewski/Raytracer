Running my ray tracer:

To compile, run make
To raytrace a scene file, use the comand: ./raytrace path_to_sceen_file

I've included a bunch of test cases in my makefile:

make test1 - renders example1.scn
make test2 - renders example2.scn
make test3 - renders example3.scn
make test4 - renders example4.scn
make test5 - renders example5.scn

make testextra - renders a few extra scene files I've included that demonstrate texturemapping spheres and spot lights

make testall - renders all scene files

NOTE: I also have an extra .scn file of a ceiling fan.  None of these make comands render the fan because it takes so long.

// Features
//--------------------------------------------------------

I have implemented all required tasks.

I've implemented anti ailiasing which is activated by running the raytracer with the command "anti" appended to it
	eg. ./raytrace Scenes/example3.scn anti

I've also implemented spot lights.  This effect is always turned on.  You just have to add a spot light to the scene file.
I've included a spotlight.scn file with a spot light set up.  You can run the raytracer on this file to see the results.

I've also tried to implement depth of field.  This effect is incomplete as I can't figure out how to set the focal point correctly
You can see what it looks like at the moment by appending "dof" to the end of a command.
	eg. ./raytrace Scenes/example4.scn dof

// Additional Scenes

I've also included a scene file called fan.scn that renders a ceiling fan my friend modeled for me.
He's taking a course on 3D animation and I asked if he had any .obj files I could use.
I've included a picture of the rendered output.  You may not want to test it as it takes a long time.
